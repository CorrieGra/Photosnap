## My process
  I was a little ill prepared for this project.
  I jumped right into it with little planning, it was no problem to get my final solution. However, I do believe that I can improve my code quality and be more clean in the future. I already created a list that I'll be using in future projects, to plan and prepare as one should to improve your development, in my opinion.
